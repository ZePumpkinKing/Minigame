Bullethell Protoype

Move around the screen with WASD, dodge projectiles and asteroids, shoot them to clear space.

Shoot control: Spacebar, 120 frame cooldown

Features:

- I recreated the spawning system from the unit 2 with many tweaks
- I wanted to make enemies that do more than just walk into you, so I wrote a script to fire projectiles in patterns and offset them
- I made a script to spin asteroids visually, I tried to randomize the direction which they spin but kept having problems

Bugs:

- sometimes when an enemy bullet collides with an asteroid, both will spin off out of the playspace.
I spent a few hours trying to fix it and managed to make it less common, but it still happens

Art Assets:

- Star Sparrow Modular Spaceships (free version)
